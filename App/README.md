## 1. nojejs-started-app
1) All hbs and js files are based on the CS 340 nodejs-starter-app code, as well as the general structure behind our app.js file. 
2) Date: 12/09/24
3) Originality: Adapted. Since we took a different approach from the database example procided for the nodejs-starter-app, only the general "bones" of the project are based on the started app.

## 2. css inspiration
1) The CSS for this project is majorly inspired by glowing buttons we found on a website called CodePen. The glowing buttons inspired us to do a dark-themed website.

3) Originality: Adapted. We only grabbed inspiration from this source, but our final button and css structure is unique.
