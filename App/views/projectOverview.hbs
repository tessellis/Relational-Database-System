                        <p>
                            The companyâ€™s current system for managing inventory, orders, and customer interactions has become increasingly inefficient. Previously, much of the order management and customer data tracking was handled manually or with outdated software, leading to errors in inventory tracking, delays in processing orders, and difficulty managing supplier relationships. As the company expands its reach and partners with these major brands, managing the sales volumes and ensuring accurate tracking of brand-specific sales and deals has become even more challenging. With the business aiming to establish a stronger online presence, these inefficiencies have become more pronounced.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To address these issues, the company is implementing a new, robust database-driven website to streamline operations, improve customer satisfaction, and ensure that inventory and supplier management are handled more effectively as they transition to a more digital approach. This system will support more accurate order processing, track brand-specific deals and sales volumes, and provide better visibility into product availability, enhancing the overall efficiency of International Sports & Outdoors operations.
